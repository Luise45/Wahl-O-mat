# Wahl-O-Mat (Full-Stack) — Backend

**Status**: In Development 

**Info**: This was developed in a team. I am not the lone author!

This repository contains the backend of the Wahl-O-Mat (Full-Stack) project. 
This is being developed for university intern elections. Last year **only 5%** of students voted in the elections. With this we hope to simplify the voting process and therefore encourage a higher number of people to give in their vote.

The voter and candidates can both give **ratings to questions.** Based on those numbers the fitting top candidates per party are given to the voters. 

The application also provides secure authentication, reset password, candidate profiles, and result calculations.
